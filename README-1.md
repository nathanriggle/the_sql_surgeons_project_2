## Description
This gym database efficiently manages fitness center operations, including memberships, payments, classes, equipment, and feedback. It tracks member and employee details, supports mentorships, and organizes class schedules with prerequisites and attendance records. Feedback from members about classes and employees can be logged and responded to. Equipment usage and maintenance are monitored, ensuring availability and safety. The database links memberships, payments, classes, and feedback, providing a streamlined system for managing daily activities. While comprehensive for operational needs, it does not handle advanced business functions like payroll or marketing, focusing instead on improving efficiency and the overall member experience.
